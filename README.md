➡️ 💡 How It Works (Flow)
1.User opens chatbot (web or IBM Watson Assistant interface)

2.User types message (e.g., "Can you recommend a mystery book?")

3.Watson Assistant processes intent (Book_Recommendation)

4.Cloud Function is triggered with parameters (genre = mystery)

5.Cloud Function calls Google Books API or uses data from Cloudant

6.Bot responds with a list of recommended books.
